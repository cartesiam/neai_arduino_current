# Smart current monitor
This project contains the source code to create your own smart current sensor using Cartesiam's NanoEdge AI Library.

## What is NanoEdge AI Library ?
NanoEdge AI Library is an artificial intelligence static library developed by Cartesiam, for embedded C software running on ARM Cortex microcontroller. This static library is generated from NanoEdge AI Studio. 
NanoEdge AI Studio's purpose is to select the best NanoEdge AI Library possible for your final hardware application, i.e. the piece of code that contains the most relevant machine learning model to your application, tuned with the optimal parameters.

See [NanoEdge AI Studio Documentation](https://cartesiam-neai-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/) for more information about NanoEdge AI Studio and NanoEdge AI Library.

## Hardware requirements
We will need the following hardware (or equivalent):
